        <h3>Hacking and Pentesting</h3>
        <p>Initially I was highly driven to learn hacking in my first year of B.Tech. Though it never gave me a
          confidence to take it up as a carrier so I chose web-development because it
          primarily enhances creativity and as a part of it I would also want to learn UI/UX, after I become full stack
          developer.</p>
        <p>Wish Me Luck!</p>

<!-------------------------------------------------DISPLAY TYPES-----------------------------------------------------------
  so there 4 types of display available , well they are inline , block , and inline-block, none. 
  so if you wanna know whats the difference then in inline the element take the exact space it requires to fit into the page and here you can't change its width or height as it is made to take the exact space it requires to fit. In case of block element it takes the height it requires but it takes the width of the whole page but in this case you can change its width to your desired width, here is twist btw after specifying the width you still can't put another element next to it.
  Now comes the inline-block element which contains the good property of both inline and block element, so you can define the width and also it takes the space it requires, another element can be placed next to it as well. so it the most flexible display type of all. none- it simply removes the content from the display, well its there but no one can see it until its display property is set to none.
  well you may hide your content in different way as well, and you may achieve it by simply setting its visibility property to hidden and what it does is, it hides the element but it keeps its original position and all the other elements still flow around it as if it's still there. It just can't be seen anymore.
-->
<!--So some of the common block elements are the paragraph tag, headers tag (h1-h6), division tags, lists and list items(ol, ul , li), and the forms tag........ so what does a block element does is it take a required height to fit itself but takes the width of whole display blocking every element and not allowing it to be placed next to it.-->
<!--so if you want to select a part in the content of a paragraph tag then you may use span tag which is not a block element(it is a inline element i.e. it takes as much space that it requires) and it allows you to style a part of content in your block element.-->
<!--so some of the common inline elements are spans, images , and the anchor tag.
